# rust-api-docs-helper package

Opens the rust standard library docs in an external browser when using the trigger hotkey on a ```use std::_``` import line.

It attempts to figure out which documentation is available for the import string (e.g. is it a struct, a function or a trait?).

## Future plans
* Opening the docs for a module or crate.
* Visual aid (e.g. on-hover "Docs available for this import" hint).
